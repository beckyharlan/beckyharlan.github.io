description: "The Anacostia River derived its name from the Nacotchtank word Anaquash, which means “village trading center.” This project is a photographic exploration of the Anacostia as an epicenter for community in Washington, D.C. Meet the people who have loved the river through its hard times—the people who treat its banks like a front porch, those who fish and kayak in its waters, and those who are tirelessly working to restore balance to the ecosystem."
